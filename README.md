En mer detaljerad README på svenska finns här: [README.sv.md](README.sv.md)

## Project 
This project was carried out using agile methods. We worked in weekly iterations and as part of the project process, we produced:

* A project vision
* A risk assessment
* A requirements specification
* A product backlog
* Manual test cases and automated tests (using Jest)
* A CI/CD pipeline for deployment (via Firebase Hosting)

The goal was not only to build a functioning system, but also to practice working as a development team in a realistic and professional workflow.
